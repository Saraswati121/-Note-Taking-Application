<h1 align="center">Note Taking Application</h1>

## About The Project

This is a Note-Taking application developed using Reactjs. This project aims to create a web-based application that allows users to create, store, edit, and delete notes. Each note has a title, description, and timestamps for the creation and last update.

## Features

1. Create Note: Users can create new notes by providing a title and a description for the note. Upon creation, the note is saved with a timestamp indicating its creation time.

2. Store Notes: The application stores all the created notes, allowing users to access and manage their notes at any time.

3. Edit Note: Users can edit the title and description of any existing note. When a note is edited, the timestamp for the last update is updated accordingly.

4. Delete Note: Users can delete any note they no longer need. This action permanently removes the note from the application.

5. Search Functionality: The application provides search functionality that allows users to search for notes based on their titles. Users can enter keywords in the search bar, and the application will display a list of matching notes.

6. Detailed Note View: Users can view the details of individual notes, including the title, description, creation timestamp, and last update timestamp. This detailed view provides a comprehensive overview of each note.
